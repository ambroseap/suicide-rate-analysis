In this suicide rate analysis, I uncovered some useful insights, and I was deeply moved by what I discovered.


📍 Out of the 7 million people who committed suicide between 1985 and 2020, 76% were male, while 24% were female. "Why is there such a huge gap?" 😳 

📍 Most of the people who committed suicide were between the ages of 35 and 54, and they were mostly male. While the gender gap exists across other age brackets, there seems to be an interesting balance  at 75 years and above. Why is the gap so wide at younger ages but almost equals at old age? 😕 

📍 The year 2000 recorded the highest suicide rate, followed by a sudden dip in 2016 which  I believe is an outlier as that figure is too low to be true looking at the trend over the years and the years after.

📍 Looking at the countries with the highest suicide rates, Russia, the United States, and Japan top the list. Russia experienced its worst suicide rate between 1994 and 1995, while the United States saw its peak in 2015, with numbers keeping increasing over the years.

There’s still alot to analyze, but let’s stop here for now.
 


Depression is real. But who really hashtag#cares?
 People will tell you, “You deserve hashtag#better. You deserve to be happy.” But how many are truly willing to hashtag#help you get there? Every day, countless people around the world fall into depression due to reasons we all recognize but often ignore.

The solution begins with one person choosing to be kind.
